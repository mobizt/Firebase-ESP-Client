## We have moved to the new library

> [!WARNING] 
> This library is now deprecated and end of life. No further supports for help and feature request.
> We recommended the [FirebaseClient](https://github.com/mobizt/FirebaseClient) library for ongoing supports.
> You have to read the library documentation thoroughly before use.

The new async [FirebaseClient](https://github.com/mobizt/FirebaseClient) library is now availavle in Arduino IDE and PlatformIO's Library Manager.

The new library provides simpler APIs interface, faster and more reliable operations.  It can use in both sync and async operations.

For Arduino NANO 33 IoT, Arduino MKR WiFi 1010, Arduino MKR VIDOR 4000, Arduino Nano RP2040 Connect, we recommend to use new async [FirebaseClient](https://github.com/mobizt/FirebaseClient) library instead of this old [Firebase-Arduino-WiFiNINA](https://github.com/mobizt/Firebase-Arduino-WiFiNINA) library.
