/** This example will show how to authenticate as user using
 * the Service Account file to create the custom token to sign in internally.
 *
 * From this example, the user will be granted to access the specific location that matches
 * the unique user ID (uid) assigned in the token.
 *
 * The anonymous user with user UID will be created if not existed.
 *
 * This example will modify the database rules to set up the security rule which need to
 * guard the unauthorized access with the uid and custom claims assigned in the token.
